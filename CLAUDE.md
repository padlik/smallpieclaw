### CRITICAL: Skill loading

**Before invoking ANY OpenSpec stage or /opsx command, you MUST load TWO skills:**

1. Load `openspec-workflow` — the standard workflow framework
2. Load the stage-specific skill (e.g. `openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-propose`, etc.)

**Concrete triggers — load both skills when you see:**
- User says `/opsx-apply`, `/opsx-propose`, `/opsx-verify`, `/opsx-archive`, `/opsx-explore`, `/opsx-sync`
- User says "implement tasks from an OpenSpec change", "apply this change", "propose a change", etc.
- You are about to run `openspec instructions apply`, `openspec status`, `openspec list`, etc.
- You are reading files under `openspec/changes/<name>/`

Failure to load `openspec-workflow` will result in missing critical workflow context.
