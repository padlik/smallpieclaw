## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Built-in tool dispatch is total and deterministic

The built-in executor MUST route every built-in tool call by tool name to exactly one
handler, and MUST return an error result (never raise) for an unknown name. This capability
governs the dispatch and confirmation *framework* only; the semantics of any individual tool
are owned by that tool's own capability (for example `secret_get` by `vault-runtime-lookup`,
`log_query` by `runtime-log-introspection`, and structured error fields by `agent-recovery`)
and are unchanged by this behaviour.

#### Scenario: A known built-in routes to its handler
- **GIVEN** the built-in executor
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `execute` with a known built-in tool name and arguments
- **THEN** the call is routed to that tool's handler
- **AND** the returned result is that handler's own result, to which dispatch adds no transformation

#### Scenario: An unknown built-in returns an error result
- **GIVEN** the built-in executor
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `execute` with a tool name that is not a built-in
- **THEN** a result with `success = False` and a non-empty `error` is returned
- **AND** no exception is raised

#### Scenario: The built-in set is enumerable and stable
- **GIVEN** the built-in executor
- **WHEN** a caller queries `is_builtin` for a name or lists `all_tools`
- **THEN** the same fixed set of 15 built-in tools is enumerated by `is_builtin` and `all_tools`

#### Scenario: Dispatch result is independent of which internal module implements a handler
- **GIVEN** the built-in executor
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `execute` for a known built-in tool
- **THEN** the result depends only on the tool name and arguments, never on which
  internal module or function holds that handler's implementation
- **AND** a caller cannot distinguish, from `execute`'s result or from
  `is_builtin`/`all_tools` enumeration, which module implements a given handler
